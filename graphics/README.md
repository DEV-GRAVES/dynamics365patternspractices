# Dynamics 365 Patterns and Practices graphics
The graphics of each end-to-end business process, business process area, and business process are available for download in this folder. New versions of the files are published regularly as new articles are published, so we always recommend that you download the latest version each time you start a new project. The source graphics are created in a Microsoft Power Point files for accessibility and translation purposes. Each end-to-end process includes one file. The graphics inside each file are organized by using sections to sort and group the graphics by the busisness process area. We recommend that you download the graphics to help accelerate the deployment of your fit-gap anaylsis process and to understand how the process works by default with Dynamics 365 applications out of the box. Keep in mind that not all variations of business processes may be documented in a given diagram. You can easily customize the graphics for your business requirements by modifying the arrows, adding steps, or removing steps as required.
