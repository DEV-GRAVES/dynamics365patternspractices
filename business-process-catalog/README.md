# Microsoft Business Process Catalog
The term business process covers a wide range of structured, often sequenced, activities or tasks to achieve a predetermined organizational goal. The term can also refer to the cumulative effects of all steps progressing toward a business goal. In our articles, we illustrate this sequence of steps in flowcharts. Dynamics 365 is a suite of applications that are designed to help organization meet the organizational goals aligned to a variety of business processes focused on specific industries.

We've structured our business process content into four levels:

- End-to-end scenarios
- Areas
- Business processes
- Scenarios
